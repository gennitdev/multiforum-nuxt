# About Multiforum

Multiforum is a platform for hosting multiple forums, each with its own rules and community identity. Every forum can maintain a dedicated wiki and calendar, and the platform makes all of that content searchable so people can quickly find events, resources, and discussions across the network.

This is a work in progress that is intended to be an open-source, self-hosted platform. Topical is the name of this particular instance of Multiforum.

If you have feedback or technical problems, please open an issue in the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/gennit-project/multiforum-nuxt/issues), or email
the project maintainer at gennitdev@gmail.com.
