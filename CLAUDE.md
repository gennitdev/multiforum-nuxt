# Multiforum Development Guide

## Build & Run Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run test` - Open Cypress test runner
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests with Vitest
- `npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/discussions/createEditDeleteDiscussions.spec.cy.ts"` - Run specific test file
- `npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/discussions/**/*.spec.cy.ts"` - Run all discussions tests
- `npm run tsc` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npx eslint --fix path/to/file.vue` - Fix linting issues

## Cypress Testing (E2E)
- Use `setupTestData()` from `support/testSetup.ts` to initialize data once per test file
- Use `loginUser()` to handle authentication for tests that need it
- Avoid multiple database resets with `beforeEach` - use shared test data when possible

### Cypress Test Optimizations
- **Replace arbitrary timeouts with network waits**:
  ```javascript
  // Before: Fixed timeout that might be too short or too long
  cy.get("button").contains("Save").click().wait(3000);
  
  // After: Wait for the actual network request to complete
  cy.intercept('POST', '**/graphql').as('graphqlRequest');
  cy.get("button").contains("Save").click();
  cy.wait('@graphqlRequest').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 200);
  ```

- **Validate network responses**: Add status code checks to ensure operations completed successfully
  ```javascript
  cy.wait('@graphqlRequest').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 200);
  ```

- **Intercept specific GraphQL operations** by pattern-matching on the request body:
  ```javascript
  // Match specific GraphQL operations
  cy.intercept('POST', '**/graphql', (req) => {
    if (req.body.query.includes('createDiscussion')) {
      req.alias = 'createDiscussionRequest'
    }
  });
  
  // Later in the test
  cy.wait('@createDiscussionRequest');
  ```

## Vitest Testing (Unit)
- Unit tests are located in `tests/unit` directory
- Run all unit tests with `npm run test:unit`
- Run specific tests with `npm run test:unit -- --run tests/unit/path/to/test.spec.ts`

### Unit Test Best Practices
- **Test Real Code, Not Mocks**: Ensure tests verify actual application code rather than reimplementing logic in test files
  - Extract component logic into utility files when appropriate for better testability
  - Import and test the actual functions from your codebase rather than creating test-only implementations
- **Component Testing**:
  - Mount components to test actual validation logic, error messages, and UI state
  - Mock only external dependencies and services, not the core logic being tested
  - Verify that error/validation messages appear in the component when expected
- **Meaningful Tests**: Tests should validate application behavior, not trivial language features
  - Avoid tests that only check basic JavaScript functionality
  - Focus on edge cases, expected validations, and user interactions
- **Testable Code**: Refactor components to make logic more testable
  - Move complex formatting/validation logic to separate utility files
  - Use dependency injection to make components easier to test
- **Test Structure**: Organize tests to mirror the structure of the code being tested
  - Group related tests with descriptive names
  - Test both success and failure paths

## Pre-commit Workflow
- TypeScript type checking and unit tests run automatically before each commit
- The pre-commit hook runs the `verify` command which includes:
  - TypeScript type checking (`npm run tsc`)
  - Unit tests (`npm run test:unit:run`)
- Modified files are checked with lint-staged
  - TS and Vue files: ESLint + unit tests
  - Test files: Run the specific test that changed
- To skip pre-commit hooks temporarily: `git commit --no-verify`

## Code Style Guidelines
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing whenever possible, proper interfaces in `types/` directory
- **Function Parameters**: For functions with more than one parameter, use a typed object instead of positional arguments
  ```typescript
  // Avoid:
  function updateUser(id: string, name: string, email: string) { ... }
  
  // Prefer:
  type UpdateUserParams = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
  };
  function updateUser(params: UpdateUserParams) { ... }
  ```
- **Vue Components**: Use script setup API with TypeScript and properly typed props/emits
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch with specific error types, validate GraphQL responses
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/interfaces
- **Imports**: Group imports by type (Vue, libraries, local components, utils)
- **Testing**: Each feature requires Cypress tests, seed data before tests and clean up after
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind utility classes, dark mode compatible with `dark:` prefix
- **Composables**: Extract reusable logic into composables under `composables/` directory

## Cypress Testing Guidelines
- **Always use URL constants**: Never use relative URLs like `cy.visit('/')` in tests
  - Use the constants defined in `tests/cypress/e2e/constants.ts` for all URLs
  - Example: `cy.visit(DISCUSSION_LIST)` instead of `cy.visit('/')`
- **Use network waiting**: Wait for requests to complete rather than arbitrary timeouts
  ```typescript
  // Set up interception
  cy.intercept('POST', '**/graphql').as('graphqlRequest');
  // Perform action
  cy.get('button').click();
  // Wait for request to complete
  cy.wait('@graphqlRequest').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 200);
  ```

## Permission System

The application has two separate but related permission systems:

1. **User Permissions** - Control what regular users can do (create content, upvote, etc.)
2. **Moderator Permissions** - Control what moderators can do (archive content, give feedback, etc.)

### User Permission Levels

1. **Standard Users**:
   - Use the DefaultChannelRole for the channel (or DefaultServerRole as fallback)
   - Have permissions like createDiscussion, createComment, upvoteContent, etc.

2. **Channel Admins/Owners**:
   - Users in the `Channel.Admins` list
   - Have all user and moderator permissions automatically

3. **Suspended Users**:
   - Users in the `Channel.SuspendedUsers` list
   - Have very restricted permissions via SuspendedRole (or DefaultSuspendedRole as fallback)

### Moderator Permission Levels

1. **Standard/Normal Moderators**:
   - All authenticated users are considered standard moderators by default
   - Not explicitly included in `Channel.Moderators` list, not in `Channel.SuspendedMods`
   - Can perform basic moderation actions (report, give feedback) based on DefaultModRole
   - These permissions are controlled by the DefaultModRole configuration

2. **Elevated Moderators**:
   - Explicitly included in the `Channel.Moderators` list
   - Have additional permissions beyond standard moderators
   - Can typically archive content, manage other moderators, etc.
   - These permissions are controlled by the ElevatedModRole configuration

3. **Suspended Moderators**:
   - Included in the `Channel.SuspendedMods` list
   - Have severely restricted permissions
   - These permissions are controlled by the SuspendedModRole configuration

### Important Concepts

- **Role Determination**:
  - User roles are determined by admin/owner status and suspension status
  - Mod roles are determined by presence in Moderators or SuspendedMods lists
  
- **Permission Flow**:
  - Channel-specific roles take precedence over server-wide defaults
  - Channel owners/admins bypass all permission checks (both user and mod)
  - Suspended status overrides all other status for that permission type
  
- **Fallback Chain**:
  - Channel-specific roles -> Server default roles -> Deny access

- **User vs. Mod Actions**:
  - Some UI actions require BOTH user and mod permissions
  - For example, to archive content: need canHideDiscussion (mod) AND be an elevated mod or admin

### Permission Implementation

- The `permissionUtils.ts` file contains the core permission checking logic for both systems
- The `headerPermissionUtils.ts` file implements component-specific permission logic for UI elements
- Channel owners/admins (users in `Channel.Admins` list) bypass all permission checks

### Permission Checking Flow

1. Check if the user is a channel owner/admin - if yes, grant all permissions
2. Check user suspension status - if suspended, use suspended role permissions
3. Check mod suspension status - if suspended mod, use suspended mod role permissions
4. Check if the user is an elevated mod - if yes, use elevated mod role permissions
5. Otherwise, use standard user/mod role permissions

Any UI component should respect the permissions provided by these roles without adding additional restrictions.

### Common Issues
- The moderator menus in headers (Discussion/Event/Comment) should show the "Give Feedback" and "Report" options for standard moderators
- The "Moderation Actions" menu section should appear for any user who has at least one moderation permission
- Ensure menu items are generated correctly in each header component by checking for specific permissions, not just moderator status

### Testing Moderator Permissions
When testing moderator permissions:
- Make sure the test user has the expected permission level
- Check that appropriate UI elements appear based on permission level
- Verify that unprivileged users don't see moderation options
- Test that suspended moderators can't access moderation features

## Project Structure
- Components in `components/` directory with subdirectories for features
- Pages in `pages/` directory matching route structure
- GraphQL queries/mutations in `graphQLData/` by domain
- Types in `types/` directory
- Utility functions in `utils/` directory (including permission utilities)

## Working with Claude
- **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes rather than large sweeping changes
  - Work on one test file at a time rather than multiple tests at once
  - Fix specific issues incrementally rather than rewriting multiple files
- **Step-by-Step Approach**: If multiple files need changes, address them one at a time
  - First understand the issue, then propose a targeted solution
  - Get confirmation before proceeding to the next file
- **Show Your Work**: Explain reasoning behind changes, especially for complex fixes
  - When troubleshooting, describe the issue and how the solution addresses it
  - Provide context for why a particular approach was chosen
